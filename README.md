**nadder** is an experimental web framework, built to find a middle ground
between speed, reliability, simplicity, capability and extensibility. It is
designed for just-in-time rendering, with support for a variety of formats
and processors.

It's inspired by:

- [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev), Deno's own next-gen web framework.
- [Lume](https://lume.land), a simple & elegant static site generator for Deno.
- and [Aleph.js](https://github.com/alephjs/aleph.js), a full-stack framework for Deno.

For production use-cases, the above are recommended over nadder.
